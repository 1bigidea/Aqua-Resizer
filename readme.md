# [Aqua Resizer](http://aquagraphite.com/)
# Version 1.0

This small script will allow you to resize & crop WordPress images uploaded via the media uploader. It relies on WP's native functions to resize the images, and checks if there is an already resized version of the image so that it won't be wasting your server's resources to regenerate the images.

## Why use it?

There are a couple of image resizing script out there that already have this function. However, I find them a little somewhat a little complicated to use, or having limitations that I don't want to deal with while developing my themes.

With Aqua Resizer, the only required inputs are the URL and width. It's easy, fast & efficient. Additionally, you have the additional options such as the height, crop, and array return.

## How to use

Simple copy the functions into your functions.php file or anywhere in your theme where WordPress can read it, then you're good to go.
